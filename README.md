# BattleTanks
An open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal 4.

This project is part of the Complete Unreal Creator course on Udemy, see [here](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse?couponCode=GitHubSpecial) for a special GitHub offer. The full course is part [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/learn-to-make-video-games-unreal-developer-course) Kickstarter campaign which ahs over 1000% funded.

These are my personal files from the course. Some changes that I have made may not be represented in the course material. These files are not the actual tutorial videos but will reflect similar work as the tutorial videos.
